### Repository requirements

Step 1. First, install Anaconda, then create an environment using the command line with the following commands:
```
conda create --name evt python=3.7.10
conda activate met
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 2. After creating the environment, activate it using:
```
conda activate met
```

### Dataset prepare
The datasets must be downloaded from their source and place it in the `./datasets` directory:
 - DVS128: https://research.ibm.com/interactive/dvsgesture/
 - SL-Animals-DVS: http://www2.imse-cnm.csic.es/neuromorphs/index.php/SL-ANIMALS-DVS-Database


### Event-based motion feature extraction

Visual motion estimation: To execute parallel_main.m in Matlab, use the following command:
```
run('parallel_main.m')
```

Optical flow estimation (E-Raft):

Step 1. Install Anaconda, then create an environment using the command line with the following command:
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

Step 2. Activate the environment created in the previous step with:
```
conda activate eRaft
```

Step 3. Use `aedat_to_h5.py` in each dataset to create the necessary `event.h5`, `image_timestamps.txt`, and `test_forward_flow_timestamps.csv` files for E-Raft.

Step 4. Run the eRaft main program using the command:
```
python3 main.py --path data/DVS_Gesture -v
```


### Dataset preprocessing
Preprocess each dataset using the scripts in the `./dataset_script` directory.

If the dataset is [DvsGesture], [DvsGesture_VM], or [DvsGesture_OF], preprocessing involves two steps:

[DvsGesture]:
```
python dvs128_split_dataset.py
python dvs128.py 
```

[DvsGesture_VM]:
```
python dvs128_VM_split_dataset.py
python dvs128_VM.py
```
[DvsGesture_OF]:
```
python dvs128_OF_split_dataset.py
python dvs128_OF.py
```

For datasets such as [SL_Animals], [SL_Animals_VM], [SL_Animals_OF], [UCF11], [UCF11_VM], [UCF11_OF], [IITM], [IITM_VM], [IITM_OF], [Fall detection dataset], [FDD_VM], [FDD_OF], only the corresponding preprocessing script for each dataset needs to be executed.


### MET training

Open train.py and adjust the corresponding pretrain model and weights based on the dataset being used. 
After verifying everything is correct, you can execute MET Training with the command:
```
python train.py
```


### MET evaluating

Use the command to perform testing on the trained models in the ./pretrained_models/tests/ directory. 
Evaluation results include FLOPs, parameters, average activated patches, average processing time, and validation accuracy.
```
python evalution_states.py
```
